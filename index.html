	<p>
	At Bridgeway Sober Living, you get to stay at a home with the best, most healing environment Austin has to offer. And in the best locations in 78704! Each of our sober houses is designed to give you comfort as you transition from a structured rehab facility to your real-life and responsibilities.Sobriety can be difficult to maintain once you’re out of a regulated rehabilitation facility. Although you may be mentally stronger and better able to resist temptation, you cannot control what people around you will do. Their casual drinking or smoking may trigger something in you and cause a relapse, pulling you back instead of pushing you forward. That is why our sober living homes in Austin, TX are a great option for your effective transition from rehab to real life.
